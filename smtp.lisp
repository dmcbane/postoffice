;; the exported functions:

;; (send-letter "mail-server" "from" "to" "message" 
;;		&key cc bcc subject reply-to headers)
;;								
;;  
;;    sends a message to the mail server (which may be a relay server
;;    or the final destination).  "from" is the address to be given
;;    as the sender.  "to" can be a string or a list of strings naming
;;    recipients.   
;;    "message" is the message to be sent
;;    cc and bcc can be either be a string or a  list of strings
;;	naming recipients.  All cc's and bcc's are sent the message
;;	but the bcc's aren't included in the header created.
;;    reply-to's value is a string and in cases a Reply-To header
;;	 to be created.
;;    headers is a string or list of stings. These are raw header lines
;;	added to the header build to send out.
;;
;;    This builds a header and inserts the optional cc, bcc, 
;;    subject and reply-to  lines.
;;
;; (send-smtp "mail-server" "from" "to" &rest messages)
;;    this is like send-letter except that it doesn't build a header.
;;    the messages should contain a header (and if not then sendmail
;;    notices this and builds one -- other MTAs may not be that smart).
;;    The messages ia  list of strings to be concatenated together
;;    and sent as one message
;;
;;
;;  (test-email-address "user@machine.com")
;;    return t is this could be a valid email address on the machine
;;    named.  Do this by contacting the mail server and using the VRFY
;;    command from smtp.  Since some mail servers don't implement VRFY
;;    we return t if VRFY doesn't work.
;;    nil means that this address is bad (or we can't make contact with
;;    the mail server, which could of course be a transient problem).
